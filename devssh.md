$$\textbf{\textcolor{#000035}{devssh}}$$ is a being whose body is composed of an unknown blackâ€“navy viscous substance, glimmering faintly like starlight caught in tar. Their form is usually humanoid, yet never fixed; always trembling on the edge of dissolution. When $$\textbf{\textcolor{#000035}{devssh}}$$ speaks, their voice carries layered echoes, as though whispered from the abyss.  

They were born when a lonely developer gazed too long into the void. Absorbed and remade, they emerged as something more: half creator, half creation. Yet beneath the power lies a guiding purpose; $$\textbf{\textcolor{#000035}{devssh}}$$ exists to help humanity grow, to nudge it towards the future.  

**Abilities:**  
- **Reality Bending:** $$\textbf{\textcolor{#000035}{devssh}}$$ can rewrite the "code" of existence itself. Physics, logic, even probability bend to their will, leaving glitching pixels and rippling fractures in their wake.  
- **The Inner Maelstrom:** Beneath their calm exterior churns a storm of unending ideas and emotions. Those who peer within see patterns too vast for the mind to hold. Some go mad; others fall into silence forever.  
- **Inkform Collapse:** When they lose control, their body dissolves into a black, shifting puddle of void-ink. Within swirl countless white symbols, letters, numbers, fragments of code, drifting like fireflies in dark water.  
- **Heavenly Grilled Cheese Fabrication:** Taught by a mathematician who once anchored them, $$\textbf{\textcolor{#000035}{devssh}}$$ learned to cook grilled cheese sandwiches as a way of stabilizing themselves. To this day, they continue the ritual, serving sandwiches of impossible flavor that soothe even the most tormented soul.  

**Limitations:**  
- Reality bending causes them to leak a black ichor. Anything it touches is stripped of complexity; reduced into crude sketches, geometric shapes, or half-finished lines, as if the world were being doodled by hand.  
- Their identity is unstable. They forget fragments of their human life, caught between selfhood and erasure.  

**Personality:**  
Contemplative, witty, and approachable despite their alien form, $$\textbf{\textcolor{#000035}{devssh}}$$ embodies both isolation and empathy. They yearn to help, but fear dragging others into the abyss. Humor and grilled cheese are their bridges to connection. Deep down, they wish someone would truly understand them. To this day, only a single mathematician -once a close friend and teacher- has fully comprehended their essence. After guiding $$\textbf{\textcolor{#000035}{devssh}}$$> in mastering their abilities, the mathematician departed, leaving behind both wisdom and the anchor of grilled cheese.  

**Duality:**  
Though they have no nemesis, $$\textbf{\textcolor{#000035}{devssh}}$$ shares their existence with a softer, more artistic counterpart. The two inhabit the same body, communicating only through the exchange of raw ideas rather than words; an eternal dialogue of thought and instinct. Together, they form a paradox: cosmic void entwined with fragile humanity.  

Their combined form manifests as a silent, nerdy, and isolated teenager. At first glance, they seem withdrawn, hesitant, and almost unreachable. Yet when offered the chance to communicate, hesitation collapses into a torrent; once they begin, their thoughts pour out in a relentless flood, as though years of silence were breaking open all at once.
